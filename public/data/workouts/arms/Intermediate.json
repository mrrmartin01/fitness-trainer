        "instructions": "Start out by placing a barbell on one side of a flat bench. Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench. Use your arms to grab the barbell with a pronated grip (palms down) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge. Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed. You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell."

        "instructions": "Lie sideways on a flat bench with one arm holding a dumbbell and the other hand on top of the bench folded so that you can rest your head on it. Bend the elbows of the arm holding the dumbbell so that it creates a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm. Now raise the upper arm so that the forearm is parallel to the floor and perpendicular to your torso (Tip: So the forearm will be directly in front of you). The upper arm will be stationary by your torso and should be parallel to the floor (aligned with your torso at all times). This will be your starting position. As you breathe out, externally rotate your forearm so that the dumbbell is lifted up in a semicircle motion as you maintain the 90 degree angle bend between the upper arms and the forearm. You will continue this external rotation until the forearm is perpendicular to the floor and the torso pointing towards the ceiling. At this point you will hold the contraction for a second. As you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.  Caution: There is no need to go heavy with this exercise. Too much weight will cause rotator cuff injury. Variations: You can perform this exercise standing and with cables."

Squat down keeping your back flatâ€”donâ€™t bend overâ€”and grasp the weight with a neutral grip. Keep your body square as much as possible. Stand back up by extending at the hips and knees; this will be your starting position. Keeping the weight at your side and maintaining a body position that doesnâ€™t favor one side, walk forward as far as you can; if necessary turn around and return the other way. Try to beat your partner for both distance and time. Descend into a squat to lower the weight back to the floor."

Your chest should be up and your back arched, with a neutral grip on the dumbbell. Inhale just before picking up the weight. Extend through the hips and knees to deadlift the weight, sticking your opposite hand out to the side to act as a counterweight. This will be your starting position. To perform the exercise, simply walk forward holding the weight at your side. Heavier loads may require some amount of lean to remain upright. At all times maintain proper posture in the spine, keep your arms extended, and keep the shoulder in a neutral position. Walk forward the given distance, executing a turn if needed. When the route is completed return the dumbbell to the ground with a controlled squat. Do not drop the weight."
