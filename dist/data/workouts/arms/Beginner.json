        "type": "strength",
        "muscle": "forearms",
        "equipment": "barbell",
        "difficulty": "beginner",
        "instructions": "Start by standing straight and holding a barbell behind your glutes at arm's length while using a pronated grip (palms will be facing back away from the glutes) and having your hands shoulder width apart from each other. You should be looking straight forward while your feet are shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position. While exhaling, slowly elevate the barbell up by curling your wrist in a semi-circular motion towards the ceiling. Note: Your wrist should be the only body part moving for this exercise. Hold the contraction for a second and lower the barbell back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. When finished, lower the barbell down to the squat rack or the floor by bending the knees. Tip: It is easiest to either pick it up from a squat rack or have a partner hand it to you.  Variations: You can also perform this exercise with dumbbells using the same movements as described above. Another option is to use one dumbbell at a time for better isolation."

        "instructions": "Put a bench in front of a low pulley machine that has a barbell or EZ Curl attachment on it. Move the bench far enough away so that when you bring the handle to the top of your thighs tension is created on the cable due to the weight stack being moved up. Now hold the handle with both hands, palms up, using a shoulder-width grip. Step back and sit on the bench with your feet about shoulder width apart, firmly on the floor. Lean forward and place the forearms on your thighs with the back of your wrists over your knees. This will be your starting position. Lower the bar as far as possible, while inhaling and keeping a tight grip. Now curl the bar up as high as possible while contracting the forearms. Tip: Only the wrist should move; not the forearms. After a second contraction at the top go back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can be performed also with a single handle attachment (one arm at a time) or with free weights (barbells or dumbbells) using one arm and two arm variations."

Once the weight has reached the bar, slowly begin to lower the weight back down by rotating the wrist in a downward motion until the weight reaches the starting position.
